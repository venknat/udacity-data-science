# Udacity Data Science Repository

This contains project code I created for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

Each project lives in its own subdirectory of this repository:

* project1_blog_post: Project to analyze AirBnB data and report findings in a blogpost
* project2_etl_pipeline: Create an etl pipeline to convert figure eight data into structured for and classify messages based on it.

Each directory has its own README with a more detailed description of the contents.
